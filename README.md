## Description

**HR Dashboard Description:**

My aim with this dashboard is to understanding employees' status, including reasons behind attrition, average salary trends, and tenure metrics.

The HR Dashboard provides a snapshot of key HR metrics and insights, including employee demographics, recruitment status, performance evaluations, training initiatives, engagement levels, compensation details, compliance adherence, and diversity metrics. It offers customizable reporting features for tailored analysis and supports data-driven decision-making in talent management and strategic HR planning.


Ensuring within company privacy is also a must, for any data analyst. Think about it like locking doors: want to make sure only the right people can see certain information.

For example, on a final dashboard, analyst should ensure:
- Employees can only see their own stuff.
- Managers can see info for their team.
- HR folks can see everything.

A user-friendly dashboard is key. It should be intuitive enough for non-technical stakeholder to navigate effortlessly.

Moreover, I've incorporated three slicers into the dashboard to enable dynamic filtering based on gender, work type, and reasons for leaving.
